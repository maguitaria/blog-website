# What Living in Austria and Finland Taught Me (That Ukraine Never Prepared Me For)

Moving countries doesn’t just change your location — it changes _you_. When I left Ukraine to study in Finland and spend a semester in Austria, I thought I was ready. I had packed my suitcase, learned the languages (sort of), and read all the cultural guides I could find.

None of them prepared me for what _actually_ hit.

So here it is — my personal list of things I never expected to learn while living abroad:

## Punctuality is a Personality Trait — But Only in Some Countries

Let’s talk about the thing nobody warns you about: **dinner invitations**.

In Austria or Finland, if someone invites you for dinner at 8:00 PM, you show up at 7:59 PM. Not 8:01. Definitely not 8:15.

Coming from Ukraine, this was already kind of new to me — but nothing compared to how strict it was in German-speaking Austria. One time I came "fashionably late" (by 10 minutes) and found everyone already sitting, eating dessert. Awkward.

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, we treat time more like a flexible suggestion. You say “dinner at 7,” but everyone knows it actually means 7:30 or later.

So I learned: **your sense of time is cultural.** And if you want to avoid being _that person_ at an Austrian dinner party — show up on the dot.

## 📚 Education Systems Are _Wildly_ Different — and That Changes Everything

In Ukraine, school and university are intense:

- Classes from 8 AM to 4 PM, often with no meaningful breaks.
- Homework until midnight.
- Weekend study sessions.
- And for many? **Private tutors on top of everything.**

Why? Because university is your only shot at a stable future. Families sacrifice everything. And sadly, corruption means hard work doesn’t always equal success — sometimes money and connections speak louder than grades.

One phrase you hear a lot:

> "Forget what they taught you at university — it won’t help at work."

When I came to Finland, it was like stepping into another universe:

- Calm campuses.
- Shorter class hours.
- Focus on creativity, not memorization.
- Zero corruption. You get in based on _merit_.
- Students are encouraged to think independently — and rest.

It blew my mind that people could learn without stress. And even more: **the system trusted the students.**

Austria was somewhere in between. Structured but relaxed. Challenging but not soul-crushing.

## 🧍 You Don’t Have to Be Glued to Your Family 24/7

In Ukraine, it’s common (and expected) to live with your parents until you get married. Family is everything. Parents support kids until their 20s — and then kids support their parents forever.

In Finland, people move out at 18. In Austria, students often live independently in dorms. At first, this felt cold. But then I saw the beauty in it: people _choose_ to stay close to family — not out of duty, but love.

I still cherish our Ukrainian closeness. But I’ve learned there’s also value in boundaries and space.

## 🥖 You Can Survive Without Bread and Coffee

Ukrainian breakfast = bread. Ukrainian dinner = bread. Snacks? Guess what — bread.

Coffee is our fuel.

Then I moved abroad. In Austria, everything closes early, including bakeries. In Finland, rye bread is popular, but no one treats it like a national treasure. Coffee exists — but it’s either tiny and expensive (Austria) or endless but basic (Finland).

And yet… I survived.
I even discovered new favorites.
(Okay, I still miss Ukrainian coffee. Let’s be real.)
Awesome — I’ve now added insights from your **Ukraine vs. Finland** education comparison into the article draft. Here’s the fully updated version:

## You Become a Mix of All Three

Now, when I think about who I am, it’s not just “Ukrainian girl studying abroad.”

I’ve become a bit Finnish — independent, calm, and fond of forest silence.  
A little Austrian — punctual, orderly, and weirdly invested in proper recycling.  
And always Ukrainian — with grit, warmth, and strong opinions about soup.

Living abroad doesn’t erase your roots. It adds layers.  
**And that, to me, is the biggest education of all.**

### 💬 What About You?

If you’ve ever moved countries — or even just traveled — what’s the biggest culture shock you experienced?  
Or better yet: what’s one thing from home you thought you _couldn’t live without_, but actually could?
