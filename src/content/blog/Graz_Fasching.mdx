## Fasching Festival in Graz: A Colorful Tradition

Graz comes alive during _Fasching_, the traditional Austrian Carnival celebration, which is an event not to be missed! Fasching is a time for joy, creativity, and, of course, indulgence. People of all ages dress up in a wide variety of costumes, from the whimsical to the downright bizarre. The streets are filled with vibrant parades, lively music, and colorful floats, creating a festive atmosphere throughout the city. It is a great time to see the lighter side of Graz and join in the fun of one of Austria's oldest and most beloved traditions.
A key element of Fasching celebrations is the food—particularly the _Krapfen_ (doughnuts), which are a staple of the season. During Fasching, bakeries across Graz sell an assortment of delicious _Krapfen_ filled with a variety of sweet fillings such as apricot, raspberry, or custard. These pastries are so popular that the average Austrian consumes around 10.2 _Krapfen_ per year, with a significant portion of that consumption occurring during Fasching. The irresistible doughnuts are a perfect accompaniment to the festive spirit, as families and friends gather to enjoy them while celebrating.

## Fasching and Food: A Sweet Pairing
