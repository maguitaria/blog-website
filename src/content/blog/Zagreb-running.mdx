# 🗺️ Running Is the Best Way to Discover a New City — Here’s How I Did It in Zagreb

During my spontaneous trip to Zagreb, I packed my running shoes and decided to explore the city step by step — quite literally. I ran through parks, across bridges, around lakes, and even spotted the Alps from the top of a mountain. And you can too.

Here’s how to discover Zagreb through running — with tips on what to pack, where to run, and how to turn each session into an experience.

# 🌉 The Embankment Along the River Sava

This scenic stretch follows the **River Sava**, crossing the full width of Zagreb. It’s one of the most iconic running spots for locals — wide, flat, peaceful, and long enough for serious distance.

- **How to get there:** Head **south from the city center**. It's about **30 minutes by tram or 10 minutes by car**.
- **Pro tip:** There are **multiple bridges**, spaced roughly **2 km apart** — great natural markers to track your distance (especially useful before GPS watches were a thing).
- Ideal for **sunset jogs**, relaxed morning runs, or long weekend efforts.

# 🌊 Lake Jarun – A Flat Runner’s Paradise

If you prefer circuit runs with water views, head to **Lake Jarun**, right by the Sava river. The **largest loop** is **6.5 km**, with a mix of **asphalt and off-road** terrain — perfect for runners who like variety.

What makes Jarun special is that it’s more than just a running path. The area has:

- Outdoor gym equipment
- Table tennis tables
- Skating and biking lanes
- Cafés and barbecue spots for post-run chill time

It's a true **recreational zone** — run, train, relax, repeat.

# 🥇 City Running Tips from Experience

Here are my top takeaways after running across Zagreb:

- **Avoid main roads** if you want a calm experience — choose parks, school stadiums, or embankments.
- **Start small** and adjust to the local terrain and weather.
- **Running in Maksimir Park** was my personal favorite — peaceful, green, and vibrant.
- Always carry a card, phone, and some water (especially in summer).
- After a run, reward yourself with **ćevapčići** from a local grill. You earned it!

# 🎒 Packing Tips for Runners on the Go

- **Pack 2–3 moisture-wicking outfits** (they dry fast and are easy to wash)
- Bring **one solid pair of running shoes**
- Use **packing cubes** to stay organized
- Pack travel detergent or soap sheets
- Include essentials like **a quick-dry towel, anti-chafing balm, and water bottle**

Running while traveling is one of the best ways to stay grounded, energized, and connected to your environment. In Zagreb, I found a new love for the city through its paths, parks, and peaks.
