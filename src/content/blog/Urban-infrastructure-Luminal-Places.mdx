# Interrogating Texts and Vantage Points

A crucial aspect of my trove development is interrogating texts through different vantage points:

- The Self as Viewer: How do these works relate to my experiences and aspirations?
- The Author’s Perspective: What messages and intentions are embedded in these works?
- Alternative Viewpoints: How can others interpret and challenge these ideas?

## Frances Yates - The Art of Memory

- Explores mnemonic techniques and their impact on knowledge structures.
- Investigates historical methods of storing and organizing information.
- Yates provides a deeply historical and personal perspective, emphasizing the lived experience of memory systems.

### Notable Insights from Yates

> _“What are we to make of the extraordinary sequence of Giordano Bruno's works on memory? They all belong closely together, are all interlocked with one another... Are they all traces of the passage through Europe of a prophet of a new religion transmitting messages in a code, the memory code?”_

> _“There is in the Cena something which reminds one of the obscure struggles of the people in Kafka's world, and that is the kind of level on which these dialogues should be read.”_

> _“The Globe was at once rebuilt on the same foundations and on the same lines as its predecessor though more magnificent. This new playhouse was said to be 'the fairest that ever was in England.'”_

## Mark Lombardi - Narrative Structures

- Demonstrates how information visualization shapes understanding.
- Relates to urban networks and city planning models.
- Focuses on the intersection of politics, finance, and corruption through art.

### Notable Insights from Lombardi

> _“I call them ‘narrative structures’ because each consists of a network of lines and notations which are meant to convey a story, typically about a recent event of interest to me, like the collapse of a large international bank, trading company, or investment house.”_

> _“When FBI agents went to arrest the bank’s CEO, his secretary calmly informed them, ‘He’s out fishing with Vice President Rockefeller.’ Byzantine? No doubt about it. It’s enough to make your head swim.”_

## Tom Phillips - A Humument

- A work of erasure poetry that transforms a found text into new meaning.
- Challenges traditional modes of textual interpretation.

> _“Every page a surprise, every word a rediscovery. The book, once one thing, becomes infinitely many things.”_

## Fritz Kahn - Scientific and Artistic Visualizations

- Explores the intersection of science, art, and diagrammatic representation.
- Offers insights into urban infrastructure through visual metaphors.

> “The body is a machine, the mind its operator. How do we visualize the invisible workings of this system?”

![](http://socks-studio.com/img/blog/fritz-kahn-industriepalast_lg.jpg) Das Leben was an encyclopedic work of 1600 pages and 1200 illustrations depicting biology as industrial and mechanical processes, adopting the most avant-garde visual techniques and contemporary styles as Neue Sachlichkeit, Dada, Surrealism, and also Constructivist photomontage.

Banned from Nazi Germany (Kahn was a prominent Jew), he escaped from Germany and, after a series of travels across Europe and the Middle East, he finally settled in the US, where he was able to publish two more books

Although selling well in the US, Kahn’s work was nonetheless heavily criticized: *“The most noteworthy feature of the publication consists in its 461 well reproduced illustrations, many of which are highly imaginative and most are instructive to a rare degree,” but also stated “At times, however, the desire for originality has gone to almost absurd extremes.”* (from The Quarterly Review of Biology).

His return to Europe, in the 1950’s was less fortunate, as Kahn further work was progressively failing in popularity. Almost forgotten, he was finally rediscovered only forty years after his death, in 1968.

# Reflection on Boundary Conditions

Daniel Crooks’ _Boundary Conditions_ explores liminality—the space between past and present, real and virtual. Crooks uses robotic motion control and post-production techniques to create a seamless, shifting reality where different spaces merge and blend, avoiding clear distinctions.

![Liminality — InsideOut Yoga](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51d95a67e4b0108eefe17101/1566903365469-J0ASME8HCIOY5RS6AZH1/liminal.png)![Guidelines to understand liminality  r/LiminalSpace](https://preview.redd.it/krwxtgfxfvg81.png?auto=webp&s=3807914c8db4fa7c8ee68a76b480e22f60640944)

### Notable Quote

> _“A doorway is a space between two spaces.”_

This aligns with smart city design—how can we create infrastructures that allow seamless movement, interaction, and transformation?

## Case Study: Azabudai Hills and the Future of Urban Spaces

_Is it a superblock, an urban village, a city within a city?_ Tokyo’s new Azabudai Hills is hard to define but easy to admire as it sets new standards for seamless mixed-used developments.

Azabudai Hills is a visionary new development in the Minato district in the heart of Tokyo. Over 30 years in the making, the project is an iconic expression of future city trends. Life and work, education and the arts, hospitality and fine dining, shopping and outdoor recreation, all blended seamlessly in a redevelopment project that turned a hilly, haphazardly spread neighborhood into Tokyo’s premier new business and tourist attraction. This mixed-use complex will be able to accommodate some 20,000 employees, 3,500 residents, and 30 million visitors annually.

![Screenshot 20250317 at 104311png](file:///var/folders/tv/qk3x2p5s6w51t_dkcg8_xz6w0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_OmwneH/Screenshot%202025-03-17%20at%2010.43.11.png?msec=1742224473535)

_Tallest building in Japan is in this complex. With my height I cannot see barely a whole entrance of the scyscraper. The feelings are so huge and amazing when standing right under it. And also beautiful grass trees around and famous TeamLab museum, English schools make an impression of well-developed district. I simply want to return there._

This new urban concept will accommodate:

- **20,000 employees**
- **3,500 residents**
- **30 million visitors annually**

The project was spearheaded by Mori Building Co., Ltd., with a mission to “Create cities, Nurture cities.”

Their vertical garden city concept allows large-scale redevelopment that resolves challenges such as:

- Deteriorating housing
- Aging infrastructure
- Traffic congestion
- Seismic hazards

By consolidating buildings into vertical tower blocks, Azabudai Hills makes space for green areas and recreation while offering state-of-the-art earthquake protection and world-class amenities.

### Liminality and the Urban Experience

Azabudai Hills exemplifies a liminal urban spacea city within a city, where the transition between spaces is deliberately designed to be fluid. Like Crooks’ _Boundary Conditions_, the design blurs conventional boundaries, offering new possibilities for urban living.

> Working with a complicated, irregular-shaped plot spanning more than eight hectares, the studio has sought to bring harmony and to create a distinctive identity that is particular to Tokyo. The team devised a pergola-like system scaled up to district proportions to organise and unify many different elements of various sizes. In this way, the design allows for significant green space both at ground level and climbing up the podium buildings, without sacrificing connectivity to the ground.  Echoing the natural forms of the project’s valley setting, the undulating structure rises like a gently sloping hillside before puncturing the ground to allow natural light to pour deep into the basement retail zones.
>
> Azabudai Hills opened in 2023 and is expected receive twenty-five to thirty million visitors annually.
>
> Tall buildings need to avoid swaying in the wind and given the high likelihood of earthquakes in Tokyo, the most stringent standards apply. In addition to high stiffness requirements, provided by filling steel tubes with high-strength concrete, viscous dampers, oil dampers, and Active Mass Damper devices are used. But the approximately 330-meter Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower does not just protect its own residents: 3,600 additional people can find shelter from earthquakes inside the building and storage space for disaster relief supplies has also been included.

## Brutalism and Liminal Space in Kyiv

Another example of liminality in urban environments is seen in Kyiv’s Brutalist architecture

One significant site is the is the Vernadskyi National Librarydesigned by architects V. Hopkalo, V. Grechin, and V. Piskovsky. The library’s monumental concrete and glass structure stands as the largest in Ukraine and is recognized as a protected landmark. Its imposing facade, decorated with a distinctive window element, showcases the stark yet poetic essence of Brutalism.

Another remarkable example Kyiv Bus Terminaldesigned by architects A. Miletsky, I. N. Melnyk, and E. Bilskiy. The upper floor features mosaics created by artists A. Rybachuk and V. Melnichenko, integrating artwork with architecture in a way that blurs conventional divisions between function and aesthetics.

[BRUTALISMUS & CO: KYIV, PT. 2 – ostraum](https://ostraum.com/2019/12/04/stahl-beton-die-architektur-kyivs-pt-2/)

> Am Kyiver Busbahnhof aus der Feder von den Architekt*innen A. Miletsky, I. N. Melnyk und E. Bilskiy. Einige gelangweilte Gäste warten auf ihre Fahrten. Andere trinken hier einfach nur. Im oberen Stockwerk des Gebäudes finde ich aber zahllose Mosaiken zum Thema „Reisen“. Sie stammen von den Künstler*innen A. Rybachuk und V. Melnichenko. Die Mosaike sind die ersten Beispiele einer kreativen Einbindung von Künstler\*innen in Architekturprojekte. Die Motive stellen eine direkte Verbindung zur Funktion des Gebäudes her. Der Busbahnhof wird heute täglich von 7000 Fahrgästen genutzt.

> ...Seit 2015 ist in der Ukraine um viele Gebäude aus der Zeit der Sowjetunion eine Diskussion gewachsen. Darunter auch einige der Bauten, die in Teil 1 & 2 des Beitrags gezeigt wurden. Mit dem Inkrafttreten der „Dekommunisierungs-Gesetze“ unterschrieb der damalige ukrainische Präsident Poroschenko ein neues Gesetzespaket. Danach wurden zahlreiche kommunistische Denkmäler entfernt und öffentliche Plätze umbenannt. In nur 6 Monaten wurden so unter anderem 22 Städte und 44 Dörfer neu bennant...

These structures serve as liminal spaces in both form and function—places of transition where people pass through, absorb knowledge, and momentarily exist between destinations.
