This summer, we’re kicking off a brand-new research project at **FH Joanneum** that blends three exciting areas:  
🧠 **AI-powered automation**,  
🛠 **CI/CD pipelines**, and  
⚡️ **cutting-edge tools like Mojo and Modular.com**.

The goal? To explore how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be integrated into modern software development workflows to **automatically generate tests**, improve code quality, and accelerate DevOps.

---

## 🚀 Why This Research?

Writing tests is important—but let’s be real, it’s also repetitive and time-consuming. With the rise of LLMs like GPT-4 and open-source coding models, we’re now at a point where AI can assist in:

- Writing unit and integration tests
- Understanding code changes from commits or PRs
- Increasing test coverage with minimal manual effort

Our research will focus on building a **CI/CD pipeline** that integrates this kind of automation—and seeing just how far we can push it.

## 💡 What’s Mojo and Why Does It Matter?

If you haven’t heard of **Mojo**, here’s the TL;DR:

> It’s a new programming language from **Modular.com** that combines the simplicity of Python with the raw power of systems programming.

That means:

- Native hardware acceleration
- Compile-time performance
- Python compatibility
- Ideal for AI-heavy workloads

We’re not using Mojo yet—but we’re keeping a close eye on it as a potential tool for optimizing the more performance-critical parts of our future system.

---

## 🧪 What’s Planned for the Summer?

The project officially kicks off in **summer 2025**, and the first stage is all about:

- Investigating how LLMs interpret and generate test cases
- Designing a proof-of-concept CI/CD pipeline
- Exploring how tools like **Mojo** or **Modular’s inference engine** could enhance speed or flexibility

We’re starting small, but the vision is big:  
Imagine pushing code, and your pipeline **instantly understands the changes, writes tests, and runs them—all powered by AI**.

## 📬 Stay Tuned

This blog post is just the beginning. Over the coming months, we’ll share:

- Technical deep dives
- Experiments and findings
- Lessons from integrating AI into testing workflows

Whether you’re a DevOps engineer, AI enthusiast, or just curious about the future of software development—follow along. This summer, we’re testing the limits of what AI can do in your toolchain.
